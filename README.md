# Unexpected Empty Array Return in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in MATLAB: returning an empty array [] when a scalar zero (or other numerical value) is expected.  This can cause problems in subsequent calculations, leading to unexpected results or errors.

The `bug.m` file contains the faulty code. The `bugSolution.m` file provides the corrected version.

## Issue:

The function `myFunction` in `bug.m` returns an empty array `[]` instead of `0` under a particular condition. This causes issues when the output is used in further computations expecting a numeric value.

## Solution:

The solution involves replacing the empty array return with an explicit return of `0` (or another appropriate scalar). This ensures numerical consistency and prevents downstream errors.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.m` with input values that trigger the empty array return.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Compare the output with the corrected version in `bugSolution.m`.
